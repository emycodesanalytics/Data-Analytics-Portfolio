## 📁 Featured Projects

### 📊 [WPM-DWR-Automation-2025](WPM-DWR-Automation-2025/)
**Tools:** Microsoft Excel, Google Forms, Automated Google Sheets Pipeline
* Developed a full-cycle data solution to transition a manual monitoring system into an automated digital ecosystem for **Word Point Ministries**.
* **Technical Achievement:** Processed **92 responses** from **16 individuals** to build a comprehensive dashboard tracking engagement across **5 centers** in Osun State.
* **Impact:** Identified the **University of Ilesa** as the engagement lead (48 submissions) and isolated low-performing centers for strategic leadership follow-up.

### 📉 [Numerical Methods & Computational Modeling](Final-Year-Project/)
**Tools:** Maple, LaTeX
* Developed a high-order (Order 6) numerical algorithm to solve general second-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) directly.
* **Academic Achievement:** Validated accuracy against established research (Olayemi, Omole, Kuboye) and achieved a high-precision error constant.
* **Context:** This project represents the mathematical foundation of my analytical precision.

### 🏋️‍♂️ [Global Fitness Market Analysis](Fitness-Trends-Analysis/)
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* Analyzed global search trends (2018–2023) to identify shifts in the fitness industry.
* **Technical Achievement:** Isolated the 2020 "Home Workout" surge and identified regional hotspots like the **United States** and **Philippines**.

## 📈 My "Practice to Perfection" Journey
I am a **3MTT Fellow** and **ForbesBLK Member** dedicated to technical excellence in Data Analytics. I focus on "learning in public" by documenting technical workflows, data integrity processes, and automation logic.

I believe that a Data Analyst's greatest tool is the ability to present findings without bias. While I am constantly learning and refining my skills, I am committed to documenting the "why" behind the "what". You can find my recent lessons documented here and on my LinkedIn.
