## 📁 Featured Projects

### 📈 [Python-Stock-Revenue-Analysis](Stock-Revenue-Analysis-Tesla_GameStop/)
**Tools:** Python (yfinance, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, Pandas)

- Automated a live data-harvesting pipeline to analyze the correlation between stock market valuation and quarterly revenue.
- **Technical Achievement:** Engineered a custom web scraper using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract quarterly revenue from unstructured HTML tables.
- **Strategic Insights:**
  - **Tesla (TSLA):** Visualized a strong historical correlation between surging production revenue and stock appreciation, particularly during the 2020–2021 expansion phase when the market began pricing in long-term profitability.
  -  **GameStop (GME):** Quantified the historic *decoupling* of stock price from fundamental revenue during early 2021, illustrating a classic data signature of sentiment-driven market volatility.

### 📊 [WPM-DWR-Automation-2025](WPM-DWR-Automation-2025/)
**Tools:** Microsoft Excel, Google Forms, Automated Google Sheets Pipeline
* Developed a full-cycle data solution to transition a manual monitoring system into an automated digital ecosystem for **Word Point Ministries**.
* **Technical Achievement:** Processed **92 responses** from **16 individuals** to build a comprehensive dashboard tracking engagement across **5 centers** in Osun State.
* **Impact:** Identified the **University of Ilesa** as the engagement lead (48 submissions) and isolated low-performing centers for strategic leadership follow-up.

### 🛠️ [WordAlive Tracker Testing](WordAlive-Tracker-Testing/)
**Tools:** Excel, Google Forms, Excel Tables
* Automated a manual tracking system for a 100+ member community to eliminate data entry bottlenecks.
* **Technical Achievement:** Built a digital pipeline transforming raw Google Form inputs into real-time analytical dashboards.
* **Metric:** Segmented users by 50% and 60% submission rates to provide technical data for targeted retention strategies.

### 🏋️‍♂️ [Global Fitness Market Analysis](Fitness-Trends-Analysis/)
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* Analyzed global search trends (2018–2023) to identify shifts in the fitness industry.
* **Technical Achievement:** Isolated the 2020 "Home Workout" surge and identified regional hotspots like the **United States** and **Philippines**.
* **Finding:** Identified definitive peaks in digital fitness interest, providing a quantitative basis for market entry strategies.

### 🎬 [Streaming Trends Analysis](Streaming-Trends-Analysis/)
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
* Executed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 4,800+ titles to uncover entertainment industry patterns.
* **Technical Achievement:** Utilized boolean indexing and temporal segmentation to isolate 1990s content and identify outliers in genre distribution.
* **Finding:** Quantified the most frequent movie duration of the 1990s as **94 minutes**, establishing a technical benchmark for content pacing.

### 📉 [Numerical Methods & Computational Modeling](Final-Year-Project/)
**Tools:** Maple, LaTeX
* Developed a high-order (Order 6) numerical algorithm to solve general second-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) directly.
* **Academic Achievement:** Validated accuracy against established research (Olayemi, Omole, Kuboye) and achieved a high-precision error constant.
* **Context:** This project represents the mathematical foundation of my analytical precision.

## 📈 My "Practice to Perfection" Journey
I am a **3MTT Fellow** and **ForbesBLK Member** dedicated to technical excellence in Data Analytics. I focus on "learning in public" by documenting technical workflows, data integrity processes, and automation logic.

I believe that a Data Analyst's greatest tool is the ability to present findings without bias. While I am constantly learning and refining my skills, I am committed to documenting the "why" behind the "what". You can find my recent lessons documented here and on my LinkedIn.
