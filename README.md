## 📁 Featured Projects

### 📊 [WordAlive Engagement Automation](WordAlive-Engagement-Automation/)
**Tools:** Excel, Google Forms, Pivot Tables
* Automated a manual tracking system for a 100+ member reading community.
* Built a digital pipeline that transforms raw Google Form inputs into real-time engagement dashboards.
* **Key Insight:** Segmented users based on 50% and 60% submission rates to drive targeted community support.

### 📉 [Numerical Methods & Computational Modeling](Final-Year-Project/)
**Tools:** Maple, LaTeX
**Thesis (FUTA, 2025):** *An Order Six Numerical Method for Direct Solution of General Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations.*
* Developed a high-order (Order 6) numerical algorithm to solve general second-order ODEs directly, bypassing the need for reduction to first-order systems.
* **Academic Benchmarking:** Validated the method's accuracy against established research by **Olayemi (2015)**, **Omole (2023)**, **Kuboye (2021)**, and **Adesanya (2011)**.
* **Key Skill:** Applied advanced mathematical theory (Power Series, Collocation, and Stability Analysis) to achieve a high-precision error constant ($C_8 \approx -0.002116$).

### 🏋️‍♂️ [Global Fitness Market Analysis](Fitness-Trends-Analysis/)
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* Analyzed global search interest trends from 2018–2023 to identify market shifts in the fitness industry.
* **Technical Achievement:** Conducted multi-dataset merges and time-series analysis to isolate the 2020 "Home Workout" peak and identify the current resurgence of "Gym Workouts."
* **Finding:** Identified the **United States** and **Philippines** as high-growth regions for specific equipment niches based on geographic search intensity.

### 🎬 [Streaming Trends](Streaming-Trends-Analysis/)
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 4,800+ titles to uncover entertainment industry patterns for a production company specializing in nostalgic styles.
* **Finding:** Identified **94 minutes** as the most frequent movie duration of the 1990s, providing a quantitative pacing benchmark for new "nostalgic" content.

## 📈 My "Practice to Perfection" Journey
I believe that a Data Analyst's greatest tool is the ability to present findings without bias. While I am constantly learning and refining my skills, I am committed to "learning in public." You can find my recent lessons on data integrity and process automation documented here and on my LinkedIn.
