# Urban Analytics with SQL & Python: Crime, Education, and Census Data (Chicago)

## 📌 Project Overview

Cities are complex systems where **crime**, **education**, and **socioeconomic conditions** intersect.  
This project investigates those intersections using real-world datasets from the **City of Chicago**, structured into a relational database and queried using SQL.

The goal was not visualization or prediction, but **building a clean analytical pipeline**:  
raw CSV files → relational tables → SQL-driven answers to real civic questions.

## Real-World Problem

Urban decision-makers need to answer questions such as:

- Which communities experience the highest crime burden?
- How does poverty relate to crime concentration?
- What kinds of crimes occur around schools?
- Which communities face the highest socioeconomic hardship?

Answering these requires **integrated data**, not isolated spreadsheets.

## 📂 Data Sources

Official Chicago open datasets (subset versions prepared for SQL analysis):

1. [**Chicago Census Data**]("dataset/Chicago-Census-Data.csv")  
   Socioeconomic indicators and hardship index by community area  
2. [**Chicago Public Schools Data**]("dataset/Chicago-Public-Schools.csv")  
   School-level performance, safety, and attendance metrics  
3. [**Chicago Crime Data**]("dataset/Chicago-Crime-Data.csv")  
   Reported crime incidents by type, location, year, and community area  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, sqlite3)  
- SQLite  
- SQL  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- ipython-sql  

**Dependencies** are listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt).

## 🔄 Setup & Data Loading (Python ETL)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the following in a Jupyter Notebook (or Python script):

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import prettytable
prettytable.DEFAULT = 'DEFAULT'

con = sqlite3.connect("FinalDB.db")
cur = con.cursor()

df = pd.read_csv("ChicagoCensusData.csv")
df.to_sql("CENSUS_DATA", con, if_exists='replace', index=False, method="multi")

df = pd.read_csv("ChicagoPublicSchools.csv")
df.to_sql("CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS", con, if_exists='replace', index=False, method="multi")

df = pd.read_csv("ChicagoCrimeData.csv")
df.to_sql("CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA", con, if_exists='replace', index=False, method="multi")
```
3. Using magic commands to connect to the SQLite database with prefixed code, `*%%sql*` for cell magic and `*%sql*` for line magic as shown below:
```python
%load_ext sql
%sql sqlite:///FinalDB.db
```

## Analytical Questions, SQL Queries & Outcomes
### 1.  What is the total number of crimes recorded in the dataset?
```sql
%%sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA;
```
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>COUNT(*)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>533</td>
        </tr>

```sql
%%sql
SELECT `Elementary, Middle, or High School`, AVG(SAFETY_SCORE)
FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
GROUP BY `Elementary, Middle, or High School`;

            <td>East Garfield Park</td>
            <td>42.4</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Interpretation**: Riverdale, Fuller Park, Englewood, North Lawndale, East Garfield Park have the highest poverty rates.

### 8. Which community area number has the highest number of recorded crimes?
```sql

SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
FROM (
    SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COUNT(*) AS CNT
    FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
    GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
    ORDER BY CNT DESC
)
LIMIT 1;
```
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>25.0</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Interpretation**: Community area number 25.0 has the highest number of recorded crimes in the dataset.

### 9.  Which community has the highest hardship index?
```sql
%%sql
SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
FROM CENSUS_DATA
WHERE HARDSHIP_INDEX = (
    SELECT MAX(HARDSHIP_INDEX)
    FROM CENSUS_DATA
);
```
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Riverdale</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Interpretation**: Riverdale has the highest hardship index, indicating it faces significant socioeconomic challenges.

### 10. Which community (by name) recorded the highest number of crimes?
```sql
%%sql
SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME
FROM CENSUS_DATA C
JOIN (
    SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, COUNT(*) AS CRIME_COUNT
    FROM CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA
    GROUP BY COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
) D
ON C.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER = D.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER
ORDER BY CRIME_COUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Austin</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Interpretation**: Austin is the community area with the most recorded crimes in the dataset.

---
## Key Takeaways
 - Crime is unevenly distributed across Chicago communities
 - High poverty and hardship indices strongly correlate with crime concentration
 - Schools are common locations for various crime types
 - Relational databases + SQL enable powerful cross-domain insights
 - Clean data pipelines are essential for urban analytics
 - This project showcases how integrated data analysis can inform urban policy and community interventions.


## Final Note
This project shows end-to-end analytical ownership:  
Data ingestion → Database design → SQL analysis → Interpretation — all using real urban data.  
This is how civic data becomes evidence.
